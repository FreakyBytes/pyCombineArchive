pyCombineArchive
================
//A pure python library to create, modify and read [COMBINE Archives](http://co.mbine.org/documents/archive)//

**Currently under heavy development** I'm still looking forward to comments, bug reports or feature requests at any time.
However I would not recommend to use this library for anything else than testing.
